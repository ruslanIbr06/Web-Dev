    <h1>Great Big Words</h1>
    <h2>by Michael Mark & Tom Chapin</h2>

    <p>When I was a little kid,
    a "<em class="big">diminutive juvenile</em>," <br>
    I liked my folks to read to me, 
    I was an "<em class="big">eager bibliophile</em>." <br>
    Now I love words for how they sound
    And how they "<em>communicate</em>."
    Perhaps I should explain myself, that is, "<em>elucidate</em>."
    Great big words, I like <em class="big">big</em> words.
    Letter by letter, the <em class="bigger">bigger</em> the better
    Great big words. La la la la la la la la la la!</p>
